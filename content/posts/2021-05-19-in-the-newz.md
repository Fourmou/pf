You’ve probably heard that regular exercise can decrease your risk of Type 2 diabetes, heart disease and stroke. But did you know that regular exercise can improve your joint health?

Since joint health is such an important concern for so many people, we’re doing a deep dive into these three ingredients.

#### Glucosamine

What it is: Glucosamine is naturally found in synovial fluid in your joints (1). Synovial fluid helps to cushion and lubricate the joint. Chondroitin is also naturally found in the cartilage that helps to cushion your joints.

Take charge of your joint health. Whether you’re feeling it in your knees or hands, joint pain is one of the most common ailments of aging. The good news? While you can’t prevent it, with the right diet and exercise, you can manage—and even lessen—the discomforts of getting older.

#### Is there a way to eat or exercise to prevent joint pain?
