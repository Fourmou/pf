Ten Democrats, led by Foreign Relations Committee member Bob Menendez, have called on Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to explain the reasons and motives behind the dismissal of former US ambassador to Ukraine Mary Jovanovich on the backdrop of pressures exerted by both Trump's lawyers and his son to dismiss her because of her consistent position Detective later.

In a letter, members called on Pompeo to stop obstructing the ambassador's testimony in the House of Representatives and protect it from political retaliation.

House committees on the Trump parliamentary trial have also summoned Energy Secretary Rick Perry to investigate his involvement in the case. Meanwhile, House oversight, intelligence, and foreign affairs committees have summoned two Ukrainian businessmen accused of funding Trump's campaign and aiding Trump's attorney Rudy Giuliani in his efforts. An investigation has been opened into the possible presidential candidate Joe Biden and his activities in Ukraine.

**Documents from the Minister of Energy** Democratic lawmakers demanded that US Energy Secretary Rick Perry provide them with documents as part of an investigation to isolate President Donald Trump.

The chairpersons of three committees in the House of Representatives sent an official memo to Perry requiring him to submit these documents to them by October 18.

"If you refuse to comply with this memorandum, even at the request of the president or the White House, it will be a sign of obstruction of Congress and can be used against you and the president," said intelligence chiefs Adam Schiff, Foreign Affairs Elliott Engel and executive oversight Elijah Cummings.

"Recent reports have raised questions about any possible role for you in conveying the president's message to his Ukrainian counterpart," they said, referring to the telephone conversation between Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelinski.

Zelinsky said on Thursday he had not been "blackmailed" by Trump, who is suspected in the United States of suspending military assistance to Kyiv in exchange for investigating the son of his political rival Joe Biden.

**Support for isolation procedures** On the other hand, a poll revealed that more than half of Americans support the measures to isolate President Donald Trump.

The poll, conducted by Fox News, on Thursday, that 51% of those surveyed, expressed support for the investigation by the House of Representatives to isolate Trump.

The poll showed that 40% rejected the measures, and 21% said that Trump did nothing wrong.

Twenty percent said the investigation was politically motivated, while 15 percent said they did not believe the allegations against Trump.

The poll of 1,003 registered voters took place from October 6 to 8, with a margin of error of less than or more than three percentage points.

The White House recently revealed the contents of a telephone conversation Trump made with his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelinsky, on July 25, to congratulate him on his victory in the presidential elections.
