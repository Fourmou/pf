Despite the rapid change in the Internet, the principles of how to start and grow a successful online business have never changed.

In his report published by the American magazine Entropenior, the writer Allen Moon said that following these steps would help people launch and develop successful projects.

**market study**
Most business beginners make the mistake of looking for a product first rather than studying the market. Therefore, be sure to start a comprehensive market study to enhance your chances of success.

The task is to find a class of people who have failed to find a solution to a problem. This kind of market research is now easy thanks to the presence of the Internet.

Visiting online forums will help you see what people are asking and what problems they're trying to solve.

**Create a copy capable of achieving sales**
When it comes to writing a sales copy, there is a proven formula that accompanies site visitors throughout the sale process from the moment they arrive at the moment they decide to buy the product. With credibility, the testimony of people who have used your product before can help promote its acquisition.

With your sales copy, you need to focus on how well your product or service can solve people's problems or improve their lives. Position yourself by asking the question "What will I benefit from this product?"

**Design and build your own website**
Once you have identified the needs of the market and examined all aspects of the product and the sale process, the time is right to go through the design of your small business website.

The site should be simple on the one hand and able to attract the attention of individuals in less than five seconds. There are some things to consider.

For example, choose one or two types of the font with a white background, make the transition between pages clear and simple. Easy operation no more than two clicks.
Your website is your storefront, so make it a "customer-friendly".

**Use search engines to direct customers towards your site**
Pay-per-click ads are the easiest way to reach a completely new site. Pay-per-click ads appear instantly on search pages and allow you to select various keywords, as well as headlines and selling prices. Then, you can distribute keywords throughout your site to improve your ranking in search results.

**Establish an expert reputation for yourself in your field**
People usually use the Internet to find information, so you should provide this information free of charge to other sites, and you'll get better search engine rankings. The secret is to include a link to your site with every piece of information you provide. You need to be an active expert in industry forums and social networking sites where your target market is located.

This way, you will attract new readers and, better yet, each site that publishes your content will include a link that takes the reader to your page.

**Use the power of email marketing to turn visitors into buyers**
When you create an email address opt-in list, you create wealth for your online business. Customers and subscribers have given you permission to email them. This means that you give them services they have requested, and develop lifelong relationships with them.

Email marketing is also cheaper and more effective than marketing on TV or radio.

**Increase your income through first sales after-sales**
One of the most important strategies of online marketing is to develop a lasting value for the customer. In fact, at least 36% of the people who once bought you will re-acquire you again if you keep in touch with them.

Completing the first sale is the most difficult part, so you have to follow the after-sales first and the more expensive alternative to make them buy again. This can be done by offering products related to their original purchases and sending some e-loyalty vouchers that they can redeem during Their next visit.

The author stressed that despite the rapid change in the Internet, the principles of how to start and grow a successful online business has not changed at all.

If you have started small businesses online, you must stick to this sequence, and if you started your business a while ago, make a quick review to see if there is a step that you neglected.
