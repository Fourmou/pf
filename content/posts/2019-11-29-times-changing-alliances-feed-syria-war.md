    An analysis by the Middle East Times correspondent Richard Spinner says the changing alliances that fuel the war that has ravaged Syria for years are endless.

    President Donald Trump knows that his country can withdraw at any time, but it cannot fully leave.

    He also says Trump has promised to take his country out of endless wars in the Middle East, and he seemed interested in realizing that ambition on October 6 when he announced he would finally withdraw all troops from eastern Syria, but events on the Iraqi-Syrian border three weeks later Prove that words are easier than deeds.

    A US military convoy moved on the M4 highway to the Kurdish stronghold of Qamishli in northeastern Syria, and a number of helicopters headed south to transport more US troops and Bradley armored vehicles, he said.

    War and justification
    According to the writer, the war seems to have returned again, and the immediate justification for the redeployment of US forces in the region was that ISIS remained a threat in eastern Syria.

    The result, he says, was to turn this small area of â€‹â€‹desert towns into the most melting pot of rival international and local armies in the world today, with no political solution to the Syrian war in sight.

    The Americans, Kurds, and factions he described in Arabic, the Syrian, Russian and Turkish regimes - as well as smaller forces from Britain and France - are now patrolling this small territory, trying not to friction among themselves.

    He says Trump has already said that the group has been defeated and that local forces can take responsibility for controlling the remaining "jihadist" activities, but the Pentagon sees otherwise.

    The article concludes that Turkish and Russian forces are now working side by side in the wake of the Sochi Agreement, and US forces and their British and French allies have resumed patrols with the Kurdish-dominated Syrian Democratic Forces.
