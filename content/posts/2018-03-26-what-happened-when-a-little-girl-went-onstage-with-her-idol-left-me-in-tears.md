This is quite possibly Katy Perry' s sweetest duet to date. The world-famous pop star made one little girl' s dream come true when she sang with her onstage during Comedy Central' s Night Of Too Many Stars autism benefit. What made it even more special is that 11-year-old Jodi DiPiazza, who lives with autism, considers Katy Perry to be her favorite artist. Jodi loves Perry because the singer uses her music to connect with the world.

Watch as the pair step on stage and totally rock it out by singing " Firework" together.

That was awesome! I started to tear up when she gave a little smile as everyone started cheering. Even Katy Perry looked a bit choked up in the middle of the song.
