**The car where the MP and his son are being shot was Sunday night. The child succumbed to his injury while being supported by the rescue.**

A three-year-old boy was killed in Kyiv in an attack on his father, a businessman and regional elected official, according to Ukrainian police. Several suspects have been arrested.

The car where the MP and his son were being shot was Sunday night in the center of Kyiv, the police said. The attackers targeted the driver of the vehicle, but a bullet hit the child. He &#8220;succumbed to his injury in an ambulance that took him to the hospital,&#8221; police said. His father was not hurt.

Two suspects arrested  
The father of the child is Viatcheslav Sobolev, owner of an Italian restaurant, near which the attack took place, and deputy of the legislative council of the Kyiv region, where he represents the party of the former Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko.

According to Kyiv police chief Andriy Krychenko, &#8220;the reason for this fatal shooting&#8221; is a conflict-related to Mr. Sobolev&#8217;s professional activities.

Two 18 and 19-year-old suspects were arrested with a firearm. &#8220;They fired from a surrounding house,&#8221; said the boss of the Kyiv police, during a press conference.
