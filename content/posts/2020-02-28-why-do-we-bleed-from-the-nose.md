Nosebleeds or epistaxis is a mild condition, but can sometimes be a sign of an underlying disease. We sometimes bleed from the nose at night or even in the middle of the day and suddenly enough. But why is blood flowing from the nose at this precise moment? Is that bad? What to do?

## Why do we bleed from the nose?

Several reasons can explain a nosebleed. When it is transient and not serious, we speak of essential epistaxis. It is a vascular fragility that causes a rupture of the blood capillaries at the level of the vascular spot. This results in a flow of blood from the nasal cavities. This mild ailment may be due to excessive physical exertion, exposure to the sun, heat or excessive nose wicking. Bleeding from the nose during pregnancy is also very common because of the increased blood flow in the body and the secretion of hormones that promote the dilation of blood vessels.

Sometimes the causes of bleeding are more serious and indicative of a "localized" health problem such as trauma, inflammation due to an ENT infection, a tumor of the nasal cavity. This anomaly can also be "generalized" such as high blood pressure, a hemorrhagic disease or even a ruptured aneurysm.

## Bleeding nose, how to stop epistaxis?

When the blood flows through the nose, the phenomenon can be quite insignificant and it is possible to stop the "hemorrhage" yourself. It is therefore advisable to sit with your head straight (or forward) so as not to encourage the flow of fluid in the throat. We blow our nose to get rid of possible blood clots, we pinch a piece of cotton in the nostril (s) concerned and we exert pressure on the wing of the nose for 10 minutes to stop the bleeding.

If the problem persists despite several attempts, you should consult a doctor in order to receive appropriate treatment such as chewing the nasal cavity or cauterization of the nasal mucosa. Similarly, if the flow of blood is abundant, frequent, persistent and other disturbing symptoms complete the picture (pallor, dizziness, headache, etc.), it is better to consult a doctor without delay.

How to limit nosebleeds? We try to keep optimal nasal hygiene and we avoid having the nose too dry, especially in winter!
