**In a meeting with donors to the Republican Party, the White House tenant recounted on Friday the final moments of the Iranian general, killed on January 3 by an American strike.**

Donald Trump took advantage of an audience won over to his cause to deliver a very personal account of the last hours of Qassem Soleimani on Friday. In the presence of Republican Party donors gathered at his residence in Mar-a-Lago, Florida, he gave new details on the death of the Iranian general, who was killed in Baghdad on January 3 by the American army.

According to him, before the strike that targeted him, near the airport of the Iraqi capital, Soleimani &#8220;said bad things about our country&#8221;, according to an audio recording released on Saturday by CNN. &#8220;He was supposed to be invincible,&#8221; said Trump. &#8220;He said, like,&#8221; We&#8217;re going to attack your country, we&#8217;re going to kill your people. &#8221; I said, &#8220;How long do we have to listen to this shit?&#8221; &#8221;

&#8221; Two for the price of one &#8221;  
Donald Trump then reproduced the scene, imitating the soldiers who addressed him while he followed the operation simultaneously from the United States. &#8220;They said,&#8221; Sir &#8211; and you know, it comes from cameras miles in the sky. They are together, Sir [&#8230;] They have two minutes and eleven seconds to live. They are in the car. They are in an armored vehicle that is running. Sir, they have about a minute to live, sir &#8230; 30 seconds, 10, 9, 8 &#8230; &#8220;And then suddenly,&#8221; boom &#8220;. &#8220;They are no longer there, sir.&#8221; &#8221;

The American president was delighted to have eliminated &#8220;two for the price of one&#8221; because Abou Mehdi al-Mouhandis, lieutenant of Soleimani and leader of the coalition Hachd al-Chaabi, was also killed by the American strike.

Donald Trump acknowledged that the strike had &#8220;shaken the world,&#8221; but Soleimani &#8220;deserved to be hit hard,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Because he was mean, he killed [&#8230;] hundreds of thousands of people and thousands of Americans,&#8221; added the American president to the Iranian general.

A few days after Soleimani&#8217;s death, Iran retaliated by firing missiles against American targets in Iraq but did not kill anyone. In the wake of these reprisals, the Iranian army, however, shot down &#8220;by mistake&#8221; a Ukrainian airliner departing from Tehran, killing 176 people.
