To sleep better, we may need to drink some beneficial teas. In her report, published by the American “Basel” website, author Elizabeth Inks reviewed the types of tea that have relaxing properties, which help them sleep faster and for a longer period of time.

The author stated that there are some common herbs that are used in making tea to help sleep, which scientific research has proven effective.

Before reviewing these herbs, it should be emphasized that you should consult a doctor before taking them:

**1- Valerian Root**
Despite its bad smell, this medicinal plant has been used for centuries to treat many conditions, such as insomnia, stress, and headache.

At the present time, this plant is one of the most herbs that help in sleeping, with more research is needed to determine the effect of valerian root on sleep.

**2- Passionflower**
Passiflora is used to treat many health problems, including restlessness, anxiety, and fibromyalgia, and some research supports their use to help sleep.

**3- Chamomile**
This soothing tea contains antioxidants known as Apigenin, which bind to receptors in the brain responsible for relieving anxiety and stimulating sleep.

And one of the studies – which included eighty women in the postpartum period suffering from decreased sleep quality – revealed that the participants who drank chamomile tea daily for two weeks witnessed a marked improvement in the quality of their sleep.

**4- Lavender herb**
Although some studies indicate that aromatherapy with lavender may help treat insomnia, it is not clear how much lavender tea has a great impact on sleep directly.

However, Abeer Al Khozama is widely known for its soothing and anti-anxiety properties, which makes it a great choice if you suffer from night anxiety that keeps you awake.
