You&#8217;d think that people who deal with accidents, crime, and death as a part of their job would be rather grim-faced all the time. But, just like the rest of us, they also know the importance of smiling and having fun, which is why the first responders of Rock County, Wisconsin, decided to make this upbeat video.

Police officers, sheriff&#8217;s office personnel, firefighters, and dispatchers all volunteered their time to create this feel-good video&#8230;we hope you like Bruno Mars&#8217; &#8220;Uptown Funk.&#8221;

Not only is the video fun, but the message behind it is quite important, too. When asked, Rock County 911 Director Kathy Sukus, who was the brains behind the video, said that &#8220;the main idea was the camaraderie because of not a lot of counties&#8217; police, fire, and dispatch work so well together.&#8221;

It was also about &#8220;all the negative stories you see, especially about law enforcement in the past year. People are tired of seeing the bad news, so I wanted to do something to bring the community together and show Beloit in a positive light, after all the problems they&#8217;ve been having,&#8221; Sukus said, referring to the spate of shootings that have plagued the city of Beloit over the past year.
