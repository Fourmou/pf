    Brain training has already become a trend, especially after the emergence of appropriate courses and programs aimed at spreading this approach between people.

    The mind is just like the body, the brain needs training in order to grow and remain in good condition, to protect our cognitive abilities from deterioration.

    In a report published by the Russian "FPR", the author, Potapova Elizabeth, reviewed a set of methods that help improve the performance of the mind:

    Decipher mental puzzles and games
    It is recommended to choose games that depend on mathematics, speech, and logic, and allocate 15 minutes daily to play these games.

    Deciphering mental puzzles and games is a real challenge for the mind, as solving crossword puzzles, chess and other games that require mental activity can improve the speed of the brain and memory.

    Practice meditation
    Meditation has a positive effect on the mind and brain activity. During meditation, another state of mind is created as completely different processes begin in the brain, indicating that using this technique can ensure that the brain's performance improves.

    Diet
    Scientific studies have proven that our brains are affected by the food we consume, so foods that block circulation and block blood vessels, such as snacks, salt, sugar, soda, and all products that contain fast carbohydrates and saturated fats should be abandoned.

    So it is recommended to diversify the diet and add fish, seafood, eggs, milk, nuts, grains and herbs, as well as vegetables, dried fruits, honey, and berries.

    Storytelling
    The storytelling of a person is a brain-training, and to do so try to tell it beautifully and inspiringly, so that listeners are interested and enjoy what is being told to them, as well as mastering some special techniques that aim to keep people interested not only in the story but also in its narrators.

    Turn off the TV
    TV negatively affects the performance of the mind, so it is advised to turn it off, knowing that the news that is shown on TV channels is also broadcast on the Internet and on social media. Information should be filtered and spend a lot of time training the mind.

    Traditional fitness
    Training develops the brain, therefore it is recommended to learn new exercises regularly in order to improve the performance of the mind, as exercising regularly helps improve the level of memory and ability to focus, reduce stress, reduce mental stress and improve the rate of metabolism.

    Reading books
    Reading books, classic works, and texts of authors from ancient times are among the methods that help improve the performance of the mind, and access to different periods of time and cultures.

    Learn new skills
    Learning new languages helps to master new skills and stimulate many areas of the brain at one time, and it is considered one of the exercises that help in developing intelligence, as well as the brain's ability to perceive new information and learn.

    Changing habits
    Changing some habits such as walking in another way, opening the door with one hand and climbing the stairs instead of the elevator are ways that help awaken the brain and distract it from established habits and make it more alert.


    It has become commonplace for everyone to link frequent forgetfulness with a fearful Alzheimer's disease that gradually erases memories from the brain, and perhaps the alarming thing is that Alzheimer's patients do not feel as much as they are afflicted with the scale of the tragedy the disease has left on them, as much as their family and loved ones.

    Although many people think that Alzheimer's is a disease that affects only the elderly, it is unfortunate that it may also affect young people, and it is called "early Alzheimer's".

    The UK has recorded more than 42,000 early cases of dementia between the ages of 35 and 65, and this makes us face the puzzling question: Can we protect our memories from dementia?

    We can delay this by following a lifestyle that helps preserve memory and protect it from early weakness and weakness, not just by dieting, but by important daily habits, especially if the genetic factor is found for Alzheimer's.

    Among the most prominent weapons that you must arm to protect Alzheimer's memory:

    Brain Exercises
    A study published on the website of the Alzheimer's Prevention Organization revealed that exercising for 150 minutes per week reduces the risk of developing Alzheimer's by 50%, and shows that women between the ages of 40 and 60 who have exercised regularly over the past ten years have developed their memories dazzlingly.

    The study concluded that an active lifestyle has an active role in reducing the incidence of memory-related dementia, including Alzheimer's. These activities include any physical activity that raises the heartbeat and pumps more oxygen-filled blood into the circulatory system, known as cardio, cycling and running.

    And no health system overlooks that exercise is important in preventing many diseases, especially Alzheimer's.

    Sharpness of mind
    The word "sharpness of mind" is considered loose, but what is meant here is: increased alertness and concentration, and this can be developed by practicing some mental games or what is known as intelligence games, such as chess, puzzle, language puzzles, crosswords and memory games.

    A study published on the WebMed medical website revealed that these games not only protect against Alzheimer's disease but also contribute to delaying memory deterioration, even if a person actually has Alzheimer's disease.

    The study was conducted on 2,800 people over 65 years, where researchers directed them to play brain games between memory and tactics for 10 hours a week and for six weeks continuously, the study revealed a significant improvement in the daily life of Alzheimer's patient.

    These games directly help brain cells to function and enhance their ability to communicate together. Most importantly, they protect brain cells from erosion and destruction, the leading cause of Alzheimer's and memory-related dementias.

    Spiritual fitness
    The importance of physical fitness in the prevention of many diseases, but the soul needs to be nourished also and is the main supporter of human energy and the first line of defense against Alzheimer's monster and ferocious dementia, but how to support and strengthen the soul?

    The answer lies in several main axes, the most important of which is social communication, and it is not a comprehensive concept as it must be spiritual and comfortable communication with people who are similar to us and whose lives are similar to us.

    Spiritual practices include religious rituals regardless of religion, where regularity in prayer enhances a person's faith feelings and then enhances his spiritual fitness.

    And researchers confirm that spiritual fitness has a very effective role in reducing the accumulation of amyloid layers directly responsible for Alzheimer's infection. And spiritual exercise helps slow Alzheimer's outbreak in the brain even after it has been infected.

    Alzheimer's is like all diseases that require a healthy diet and avoiding foods that cause cholesterol, heart disease, and diabetes. Omega 3 is one of the most important nutritional supplements useful for preventing Alzheimer's.

    As mentioned by the medical institutions involved in Alzheimer's research, regular exercise, spiritual fitness, and mental games may reduce the risk of developing Alzheimer's by more than 50%, and one hour per day of intelligence and sports games causes you to fight the Alzheimer's fracture monster, which has become indistinguishable between the elderly and young adults.
