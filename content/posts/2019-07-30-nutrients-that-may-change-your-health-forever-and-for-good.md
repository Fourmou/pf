  So we all know that the food that we eat contains calories but looking into it more we could consider calories as energy, we can split the energy into free main types known as macronutrients these free are known as protein carbohydrates and fat. let&#8217;s take a look at protein first keep this in mind that per one gram of protein you have there are four calories so its main functions I&#8217;ll grow from repair so let&#8217;s look at an example when we&#8217;re in a gym doing an intense workout waves after that hard work out if we consume protein it will help repair and rebuild those muscles so what are its sources mostly meat containing the highest amount of protein such as chicken beef and lamb whereas other sources can include eggs fish nuts and seeds as a healthy guideline we should have a combination of all of these sources moving on to carbohydrates, now just like protein it has four calories per one gram now carbohydrates are our body&#8217;s most preferred source of energy overall 3 the main function of this macronutrient is simply providing us with energy to go through things such as physical activities like linen now carbohydrates can be broken down into two kinds known as simple and complex carbohydrates. Now I will present to you the most effective nutrition systems.
