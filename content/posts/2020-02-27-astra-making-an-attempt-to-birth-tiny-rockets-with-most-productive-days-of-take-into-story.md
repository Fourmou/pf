Astra Dwelling is developing pump-fed, liquid bipropellant propulsion engines for DARPA and NASA.

The hot vehicle, Rocket 3.0, is designed to have confidence a payload ability of approximately 100 kg to low earth orbit. The first Rocket 3.0 vehicle has performed a static fire take a look at at Atwater. It is deliberate to beginning from Alaska and attain orbit between 25 February 2020 and April 2020.

Astra is now essentially the most straightforward competitor for the DARPA swiftly beginning project. One competitor withdrew and one other went bankrupt.

Astra is currently offering dedicated beginning services of 50kg-150kg payloads (to 500km SSO reference orbit) in 2020 and 2021.

The total blueprint fits inner a shipping container.
