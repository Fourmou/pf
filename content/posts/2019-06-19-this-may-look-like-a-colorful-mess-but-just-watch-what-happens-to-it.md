    Food should be fun. This is especially true for cakes and desserts. Yet no dessert is as much fun to make as this groovy and colorful cake. It's especially fun because it hides a surprise heart on the inside. It's also just as much fun to eat as it is to make.
    It's not the easiest cake to make, as a lot of work and love goes into making one. It is, however, made with love, as demonstrated so eloquently in the heart it hides.

Food should be fun. This is especially true for cakes and desserts. Yet no dessert is as much fun to make as this groovy and colorful cake. It&#8217;s especially fun because it hides a surprise heart on the inside. It&#8217;s also just as much fun to eat as it is to make.
