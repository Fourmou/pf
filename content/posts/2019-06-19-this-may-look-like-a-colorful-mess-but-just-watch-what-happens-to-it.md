Food should be fun. This is especially true for cakes and desserts. Yet no dessert is as much fun to make as this groovy and colorful cake. It’ s especially fun because it hides a surprise heart on the inside. It’ s also just as much fun to eat as it is to make.

It’ s not the easiest cake to make, as a lot of work and love goes into making one. It is, however, made with love, as demonstrated so eloquently in the heart it hides.
