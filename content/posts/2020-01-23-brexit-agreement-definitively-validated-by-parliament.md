**The text, which regulates the terms of the divorce, must still be promulgated by Queen Elizabeth II, possibly as early as Thursday, to have the force of law.**

Divorce becomes clearer. The British Parliament definitively validated the Brexit agreement on Wednesday, clearing the way for the historic exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union in nine days.

The text, which regulates the terms of the divorce, and negotiated by Conservative Prime Minister Boris Johnson with Brussels, is yet to be promulgated by Queen Elizabeth II, possibly as early as Thursday, to have the force of law.

British MPs had given their final approval in early January to the text that will allow the United Kingdom to leave the European Union on January 31 at 11 p.m. The House of Commons, largely dominated by the Conservatives, adopted the text with 330 votes in favor (231 against).

January 31, fateful date  
The text was then transmitted to the unelected House of Lords, which adopted five amendments, inflicting setbacks on the government, concerning, in particular, the rights of European citizens residing in the United Kingdom or unaccompanied refugee children.

But these changes were disavowed by MPs when the bill returned to the House of Commons on Wednesday. The upper room bowed when the text was submitted to it a second time in the afternoon.

After the Queen&#8217;s consent, the text, which translates the Brexit agreement into law, will have to be ratified by the European Parliament on January 29, two days before the fateful date.

This final adoption of the divorce agreement marks a great victory for Boris Johnson, who came to power in July 2019 by promising to achieve Brexit.

A big victory for Boris Johnson  
Parliament had so far rejected the deal negotiated by ex-Prime Minister Theresa May without proposing any other scenario, raising fears until recently of a brutal exit or a renunciation.

Boris Johnson&#8217;s Conservative election victory was a game-changer. “The British people have waited over three years for Brexit to materialize. Passing the withdrawal bill allows us to do so in an orderly fashion on January 31, ”said a spokesperson for the Prime Minister.
