The actor playing Beauty and the Beast&#8217;s Gaston at Disney World in Orlando is known for his bravado, especially after a video of a little girl putting him in his place went viral last month. However, it looks like her adorable scolding of the cartoon villain didn&#8217;t hurt his confidence, as this new video shows him accepting a push-up challenge from a young man.


  As they start, the challenger manages a series of slow push-ups, while Gaston flies through a series of fast exercises before moving onto a set of incredible one-handed push-ups. Gaston easily comes out as the victor, much to the amazement of the challenger and tourists.
