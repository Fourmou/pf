**Rod Blagojevich was serving a 14-year sentence for multiple federal corruption convictions.**

President Trump commuted Tuesday the sentence of former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich.

Until Tuesday, Blagojevich served a 14-year sentence for multiple federal corruption convictions.

In previous speeches, Trump had already said that Blagojevich’s sentence was really unfair.

“He is not from my party, but I think he was treated unfairly,” the president said last January.

In December 2008, then Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich and his team leader John Harris were charged with corruption by federal prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald.

In January 2009, Blagojevich was removed from office after being prosecuted by the Illinois Senate.

In a second trial, a jury convicted him of 17 charges including electronic fraud, attempted extortion and conspiracy to request bribes.

In December 2011, he was sentenced to 14 years in jail.

**Rob Blagojevich case count**

Among the accusations against him were corruption, bribery and the intention of obtaining personal benefits to fill the position of senator vacated by the now-former president Barack Obama.

In January 2009, the State Senate displaced Blagojevich from the position of governor, however, he said he would not give up.

“The struggle continues, that I am not governor does not mean that I will not continue fighting for you and for the causes for which I have fought all my life,” said Blagojevich shortly after the scandal broke out.

But the former governor’s legal fight was just beginning.

-   In April 2009, Blagojevich and five others involved were formally charged by the prosecution, and part of the evidence was based on recordings where the former governor is heard talking about various issues, including his apparent desire to place the best Senate bidder
-   It was until June 3, 2010  when he began the first trial against the former official who by that time had become more than a defendant, a personality recognized for his comments and for his participation in radio and television programs.
-   After days of deliberation, on August 17, 2010, the jury found him guilty of lying to the FBI and could not reach a decision in the other 23 charges. In those moments Rod Blagojevich felt like feeling victorious and confident.
-   The prosecution did not stop, and on April 20, 2011, began the second trial against the former governor, on this occasion Blagojevich let his voice heard on the stand and testified.
-   It was on June 27 when the jury reached a decision, in this case, the verdict was: guilty of 17 charges of the 20 that weighed against him, of these 11 are in relation to the attempt to sell the Senate post left by the President Barack Obama.
