　　According to reports, Kim Jong Il went to the hospital after presiding over the Politburo meeting of the Workers ’Party of Korea on April 11, and Kim Jong Un ’s last public appearance was at the Politburo meeting of the Labour Party.

　　Pyongyang fired several short-range missiles last week. Seoul officials said it was also one of the activities to celebrate Kim Il Sung ’s birthday. Such military incidents are usually inspected on the spot by Kim Jong-un, but North Korea ’s Central News Agency has no report on the test.
