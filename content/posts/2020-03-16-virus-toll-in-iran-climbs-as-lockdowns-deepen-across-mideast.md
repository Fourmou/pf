    TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — Iran reported another 129 fatalities from the new coronavirus on Monday, the largest one-day rise in deaths since it began battling the Middle East’s worst outbreak, which has claimed more than 850 lives and infected a number of senior officials in the country.
  </p>
  
  <p class="Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69">
    Businesses in Iran’s capital remained open, however, even as other countries in the region moved toward full lockdowns, with Lebanon largely shutting down and Iraqis racing to prepare for a curfew set to begin later this week.
  </p>
  
  <p class="Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69">
    The divergent approaches adopted by local authorities reflect continued uncertainty over how to slow the spread of a virus that has infected around 170,000 people worldwide and caused more than 6,500 deaths.
  </p>
  
  <p class="Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69">
    Some have opted for an even more aggressive response, with Israel authorizing the use of phone-snooping technology<!-- --> long used against Palestinian militants to track coronavirus patients. Such practices will spark renewed debate over privacy issues as countries around the world confront the pandemic.
  </p>
  
  <p class="Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69">
    Most people experience only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough, and recover within weeks. But the virus is highly contagious and can be spread by people with no visible symptoms. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.

    Panic broke out in Iraq after authorities announced a weeklong curfew late on Sunday. People raced to supermarkets and swiftly emptied shelves, while others stocked up on kerosene and cooking gas.

  </p>
  
  <p class="Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69">
    Iraq’s Health Ministry has reported 124 cases of coronavirus and nine deaths.

  </p>
  
  <p class="Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69">

    One of the worst outbreaks in the world has unfolded in Iran, which has close ties to both Iraq and Lebanon. Authorities there have reported 14,991 confirmed cases and 853 deaths.
