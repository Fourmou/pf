  British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that the negotiators of the United Kingdom and the European Union were able to reach a &#8220;new and great agreement&#8221; on Britain&#8217;s exit from the bloc.



  Johnson stressed on Twitter that parliament should vote on the deal on Saturday &#8220;so we can move on to other priorities such as living costs, crime, and the environment.&#8221;



  &#8220;We have a great, excellent new agreement that regains control of trade laws and policy, one of the promises of the Brexit camp in the 2016 referendum,&#8221; he said, calling on British lawmakers to support it in an extraordinary parliamentary session on Saturday.



  European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said Britain and the EU had been able to reach an agreement on the UK&#8217;s exit from the bloc.



  Juncker wrote in his account on the social networking site Twitter, that the new agreement &#8220;fair and balanced for both the European Union and the United Kingdom.&#8221;



  Juncker recommended the European summit in Brussels today to ratify the new agreement.



  In his first response to the announcement, opposition Labor Party leader Jeremy Corbin called on lawmakers to reject the Brexit bill.


Corbin said in a statement that the agreement &#8220;will not bring the country together and must be rejected.&#8221; &#8220;The best solution for Brexit is to give the people the final say in a public vote,&#8221; he said.


  Before Corbin, the Northern Ireland DUP declared its rejection of the agreement, and the Conservatives no longer had a majority in the House of Commons.



  It is noteworthy that with the announcement of the agreement rose the price of the pound against the dollar to 1.2990 minutes and then reached 1.2942 dollars, up 0.86%, a level not recorded since last May.
