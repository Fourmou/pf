According to Senator Andreas Geisel, the Berlin authorities are examining a ban on 16. May anti-Israel al-Quds demonstration planned. “Of course it is my aim that such anti-Semitic events do not take place in our city,” said the SPD politician on Tuesday. “We are exhausting all possibilities under the rule of law to prevent such events or to impose correspondingly tough conditions so that hatred cannot be sown.” No decision has yet been made.

“We are still working on making this impossible in our city.” On Al-Quds Day, which is the end of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan, Iran calls for the conquest of Jerusalem every year, The background is the occupation of East Jerusalem by Israel during the Six-Day War 1967. Al-Quds is the Arabic name for Jerusalem. In the previous year, up to 1200 Al-Kuds demonstrators with conditions had moved across Berlin’s Kurfürstendamm. There were also protests.  (dpa)
