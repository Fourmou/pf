As for Edward, after he abandoned the crown he became the Duke of Windsor, and lived with his wife in France, in a state close to exile until his death in 1972.

Given what happened next, some historians think that King Edward’s abdication was one of the best things he did for Britain since he assumed the throne he had sparked many conflicts in Parliament and with different politicians, and he later showed great sympathy for the Germans, who is What made Winston Churchill, the then British Prime Minister, exclude him from France and appoint him as governor of the Bahamas.

According to Norwegian law, all members of the royal family are not required to pay taxes on their income, except when they get a private job away from the palace, which Princess Martha naturally acquiesced to, until she created a separate account on the social networking site “Instagram” away from Her royal account.

However, despite the abandonment of many of the royal privileges, the princess still maintains her fourth place in the right of the mandate of the Covenant, after the death of her father, the current king.
