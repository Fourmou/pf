With the year 2020 and the new decade drawing fast, many of us are taking advantage of the year-end period to reflect on where we are now and look forward to the things we hope to achieve in the future. This is the time to think about the good and bad things you did during this year, and whether you have achieved the goals you set for yourself.

Take a break from your busy life to focus on your strengths and weaknesses, and the lessons learned this year. The ideas you gain will help enhance your chances of success and happiness in the future.

Remember, the self-reflection you take now will guide you toward success next year and beyond. &#8220;The future is full of possibilities, opportunities, and new journeys,&#8221; said author Peter Economie in a report published in the American magazine &#8220;Ink.&#8221; Here are ten personal questions that help you prepare for and achieve your goals in 2020:

1. How did your life change or remain the same as last year?  
   It is necessary to ask whether the past year was full of events, and what were the reasons behind this. It is also necessary to determine how far your decisions have made changes in your life, and whether you intend to make these decisions in the future.

2. What are you most proud of?  
   Do not forget to praise yourself for any good work you have done. You deserve thanks for all this hard work and perseverance. Indeed, our recognition of our successes reminds us of what we are capable of at any moment.

3. What were the most pressing things?  
   You should try to figure out ways to relieve these pressures for the New Year.

4. What are the five words that describe this year and what do you want to describe 2020?  
   It is necessary to take some time to visualize how this year has passed and how you want it to pass next year.

5. What negative habits do you want to get rid of?  
   We all have negative habits, and we have the power to stop doing them. Determine if you are very passive or indulge in fast food often. Think of a way to change your bad habits and convert them into good habits.

6. Have you missed some opportunities?  
   If so, you have to outline steps you can take now to prevent miss any further opportunity in 2020.

7. What have you started and haven&#8217;t finished with yet?  
   Think about whether you will reconsider the things you haven&#8217;t completed this year and want to complete the new year. If this helps your success and happiness in the future, you should do it.

8. What brings joy to your life?  
   Commit to doing more things that bring you happiness, and reduce the joys of your life.

9. What are you most grateful for?  
   Despite the challenges we face, we can always find something we are grateful for. Determine what blessings you enjoyed this year, and how you will remain grateful to them for the new year.

10. What is the one thing that you want others to remember when you are dead?  
    We are so busy with our daily life that we forget to think about our heritage. With this question, think about leaving a good picture of you, and think about how you can take the steps necessary to achieve this image next year.
