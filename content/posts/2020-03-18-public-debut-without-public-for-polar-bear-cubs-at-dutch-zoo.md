    THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — A pair of twin polar bear cubs have made their public debut at a Dutch zoo &#8212; but without the public because of coronavirus restrictions.
  </p>
  
  <p class="Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69">
    There was no sign of social distancing between the three-and-a-half-month-old cubs and their mother as they cautiously ventured out of the maternity den at the Ouwehands Zoo on Wednesday morning.
  </p>
  
  <p class="Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69">
    The twins stuck close to their mother, called Freedom, as they explored their outdoor enclosure for the first time since they were born on Nov. 27.
  </p>
  
  <p class="Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69">
    In video released by the zoo, Freedom kept a close eye on her cubs and gently licked the head of one as it suckled.

    The cubs are the product of a European breeding program intended to help preserve the endangered species.
  </p>
  
  <p class="Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69">
    The gender of the cubs is not yet known. Once that is established, likely after they take their first swim, the zoo has two male names &#8212; Yuku and Atlas &#8212; and two female names &#8212; Yura and Nova &#8212; ready.
  </p>
  
  <p class="Component-root-0-2-77 Component-p-0-2-69">
    The Ouwehands Zoo in the central town of Rhenen has been forced to close its doors by a government ban, in force until at least April 6, on gatherings of more than 100 people.
