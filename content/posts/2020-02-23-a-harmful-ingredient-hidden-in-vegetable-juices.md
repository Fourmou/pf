Vegetable juices are a great way to get nutrients without excessive calories, so they can substitute for a proportion of the actual vegetables, and without the effort of peeling, slicing or cooking.

It may seem beneficial, but experts say there can be a downside to vegetable juices. For example, many of them contain a large amount of sugar.

The Consumer Protection Center in the German state of Bavaria says that beet juices or carrots, for example, contain a lot of sugar naturally, although some sugar is often added to them.

Also, some juices contain added salt to improve the flavor. For example, a cup of tomato juice contains about a third of the salt that is recommended to be consumed daily.

Experts recommend examining the ingredients to see how much sugar or salt is in the juice one eats.
