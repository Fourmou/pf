Qatar Airways has bought a new stake in British Airways&#8217; IAG group, for \$ 600 million.

With this, the Qatari company raises its total stake to 25.1%, with the aim of strengthening its strategy to create a global portfolio of investments in airlines.

The previous share was 21.4%. The British group owns the Spanish companies &#8220;Iberia&#8221; and &#8220;Fowling&#8221;, in addition to the Irish &#8220;Air Lingus&#8221;.

&#8220;Our investment so far has been very successful, and the announcement of our increased contribution is evidence of our continued support for IAG and its strategy,&#8221; said Qatar Airways Group CEO Akbar Al Baker.

Qatar Airways has stakes in several international airlines, including Cathay Pacific and China Southern Airlines. The company&#8217;s first investment was in IIG in 2015, with a stake of nearly 10%, and has steadily raised since then.
