Qatar Airways has bought a new stake in British Airways’ IAG group, for \\$ 600 million.

With this, the Qatari company raises its total stake to 25.1%, with the aim of strengthening its strategy to create a global portfolio of investments in airlines.

The previous share was 21.4%. The British group owns the Spanish companies “Iberia” and “Fowling”, in addition to the Irish “Air Lingus”.

“Our investment so far has been very successful, and the announcement of our increased contribution is evidence of our continued support for IAG and its strategy,” said Qatar Airways Group CEO Akbar Al Baker.

Qatar Airways has stakes in several international airlines, including Cathay Pacific and China Southern Airlines. The company’s first investment was in IIG in 2015, with a stake of nearly 10%, and has steadily raised since then.
