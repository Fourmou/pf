    What happens when you put a boy in front of a girl and ask him to slap her? How will the kid react? Will, he actually do what the adult tells him to do, or will he refuse?
    That's what Italian video journalist Luca Lavarone wanted to find out as he conducted a social experiment with children on a busy street. Lavarone wanted to highlight the issue of violence by men against women. In the video, several boys aged between six and eleven years old are introduced to a girl and asked by an off-screen interviewer to pay her a compliment, put on a funny face to make her laugh, and caress her. They are then told to slap her.
    Watch how the young boys react to this shocking request.

    I wonder how it would end if the situation was reversed, with girls being asked to slap boys. I hope it would end the same way.
