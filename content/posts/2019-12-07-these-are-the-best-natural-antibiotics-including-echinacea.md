    There are different herbs that can act as natural antibiotics, as in addition to their role in fighting winter diseases, these herbs play an effective role against some skin diseases. But it cannot replace the industrial antibiotics that your doctor prescribes.

    One of the most well-known herbs in performing the role of natural antibiotics is Echinacea plants, the largest sorghum, propolis, or what is known as bee gum.

    Echinacea is antibacterial and antifungal
    Echinacea - or Echinacea - is a plant that is very familiar to Native Americans in North America, and they used it to treat snake bites and wounds. Its root contains several active ingredients with properties that help revitalize the immune system. Its many components work together to counter unwanted objects and improve the body's immune defense.

    "This plant contains multiple polysaccharides that protect cells from attacks of viruses and alkalis with anti-bacterial and anti-fungal properties thanks to their anti-inflammatory effect," the author quoted the pharmacist, Louth Garcia Garcia Toro, as saying.

    Experts recommend eating this kind of herbs from one to three months since the beginning of winter to prevent recurring infections. It can also be used for prevention when the body is under stress or a state of physical or psychological weakness that leads to a decrease in the immune system.

    Great Cordoba is an ideal ally for the skin
    The roots of this plant are rich in antiseptics that help fight skin diseases such as rashes or acne. This plant spreads a lot in the temperate regions.

    According to the pharmacy expert, "The larger Cordoba root is an important source of insulin, which is starch-like carbohydrates, similar to penicillin. In addition, this plant contains what are known as polyphenols, which are substances that have antibacterial and antifungal properties. These substances are of great value in the treatment of many skin diseases such as acne, eczema, boils, abscesses, or even psoriasis. "

    This plant also contains acidic alcohol that increases its antiseptic properties. These compounds purify the body of the organism from all toxins that contribute to the appearance of pimples and promote their removal at the level of the liver and kidneys.

    It is also recommended to use larger sorghum to treat oily skin problems, as it becomes more effective when combined with other plants, similar to the Pansy plant.

    Propolis or bee gum
    The writer stated that propolis is a resinous, resinous, and balsamic material with viscous coherence, obtained by bees from tree buds and some plants through his jaws, to finish processing them later inside the beehive with many secretions (candles and saliva secretions).

    Generally, propolis is obtained from several trees, such as willow, chestnut, oak, pine, cherry, poplar, birch, juniper, and some herbal plants.

    In fact, propolis bees are used to cordon off cell walls and keep them free from bacteria, fungi and other external harmful objects. In other words, they block the hives tightly.

    The most famous characteristic of propolis is that it is an active antibiotic, even against germs that have acquired antibiotic resistance.

    Some properties of propolis are also used in food, perfumes, medicines, and biology, as is the case with its antioxidant, antimicrobial, bactericidal, and antifungal and antifungal properties, as it has been proven effective in about 40 types of skin fungi.

    This plant has other interesting properties mainly in the ability to regenerate the skin by accelerating the healing process, its usefulness as a local anesthetic, and its anti-inflammatory activity.

    Some studies in China have also shown the efficacy of propolis to treat high blood pressure, atherosclerosis and heart problems. It is also used in dental clinics to treat cavities and as a natural fixator that prevents tooth enamel erosion.

    In addition, propolis can be used to treat many other conditions at different parts of the body:

    Throat, as it helps relieve symptoms associated with angina, pharyngitis, ulcers and sore throat.

    The respiratory system, as it works effectively against colds.

    Stomach, as it helps to fight stomach ulcers.

    Gynecology, it mainly works on candida, cervical ulcers, infections, and itching.

    The skin, as its main effect on fungi, can be seen although it is also effective in treating wounds, acne, ulcers, and cracks.
