Echinacea is antibacterial and antifungal
Echinacea -- or Echinacea -- is a plant that is very familiar to Native Americans in North America, and they used it to treat snake bites and wounds. Its root contains several active ingredients with properties that help revitalize the immune system. Its many components work together to counter unwanted objects and improve the body's immune defense.

"This plant contains multiple polysaccharides that protect cells from attacks of viruses and alkalis with anti-bacterial and anti-fungal properties thanks to their anti-inflammatory effect," the author quoted the pharmacist, Louth Garcia Garcia Toro, as saying.

Experts recommend eating this kind of herbs from one to three months since the beginning of winter to prevent recurring infections. It can also be used for prevention when the body is under stress or a state of physical or psychological weakness that leads to a decrease in the immune system.

Great Cordoba is an ideal ally for the skin
The roots of this plant are rich in antiseptics that help fight skin diseases such as rashes or acne. This plant spreads a lot in the temperate regions.

According to the pharmacy expert, "The larger Cordoba root is an important source of insulin, which is starch-like carbohydrates, similar to penicillin. In addition, this plant contains what are known as polyphenols, which are substances that have antibacterial and antifungal properties. These substances are of great value in the treatment of many skin diseases such as acne, eczema, boils, abscesses, or even psoriasis. "

This plant also contains acidic alcohol that increases its antiseptic properties. These compounds purify the body of the organism from all toxins that contribute to the appearance of pimples and promote their removal at the level of the liver and kidneys.

It is also recommended to use larger sorghum to treat oily skin problems, as it becomes more effective when combined with other plants, similar to the Pansy plant.

Some properties of propolis are also used in food, perfumes, medicines, and biology, as is the case with its antioxidant, antimicrobial, bactericidal, and antifungal and antifungal properties, as it has been proven effective in about 40 types of skin fungi.

This plant has other interesting properties mainly in the ability to regenerate the skin by accelerating the healing process, its usefulness as a local anesthetic, and its anti-inflammatory activity.

Some studies in China have also shown the efficacy of propolis to treat high blood pressure, atherosclerosis and heart problems. It is also used in dental clinics to treat cavities and as a natural fixator that prevents tooth enamel erosion.
