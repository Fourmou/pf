**Ever wonder why your nails are so brittle, yellow, or otherwise discolored? Though you may not know it, these seemingly harmless symptoms may indicate you have some underlying health issues.**  According to John Anthony, MD, a dermatologist at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio and Debra Jaliman, MD, a New York City-based dermatologist and author of &#8220;Skin Rules,&#8221; there are certain nail symptoms that definitely shouldn&#8217;t be ignored. Here&#8217;s what eight different nail conditions are signaling about your health.

**1. Yellow Nails**

  According to WebMD, one of the most common causes of yellow nails is a fungal infection. But in rare cases, they also say that it can indicate a more serious condition such as diabetes, thyroid disease, or lung disease. Smoking can also stain the nails yellow.


**2. Cracked or Brittle Nails**

  Dr. Jailman says cracked or brittle nails can be a sign that the nail plate is extremely dry. The condition has also been linked to thyroid disease. Hypothyroidism sometimes causes this side effect as well.


**3. Pitted Nails**

  According to MedicineNet, nail pitting is caused by the defective development of the layers of the nail plate, and it is common for those suffering from psoriasis.


**4. Ridged Nails**

  Dr. Anthony explains that the reason people will see horizontal ridges on their nails is that there could be direct trauma to the nail, or it could also be a cause of a more serious illness, in which case you’ll see it on more than one nail. That&#8217;s because the body is focusing its energy on fighting the illness rather than the nails.


**5. Discolored or Dark Lines Beneath**

  According to WebMD, discoloration or a dark line on the nail can sometimes be caused by melanoma, the most dangerous type of skin cancer. Melanoma can also cause a black line or stripe on the nail. It&#8217;s important to visit your doctor as soon as possible if you notice this.


**6. Bitten Nails**

  According to Medical Daily, the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) classifies nail-biting as one of the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder. If it becomes excessive, you should visit your doctor.


**7. Bluish Nails**

  WebMD explains that when your nails become bluish, it is a sign that the body may not be getting enough oxygen. Lung problems and heart problems are among the possible causes.


**8. White Spots**

  Some have mistakenly concluded that white spots on nails mean calcium deficiency, but Dr. Anthony says they are often a result of trauma such as hitting your finger against something.
