    The German magazine "Freuden" provided some advice and instructions that can protect against viruses and strengthen the immune system to fight viruses in the body, namely:

    1- Adjust humidity at home
    Flu viruses and colds can be fought by making sure that the humidity in the home is at least 50%.

    According to a study conducted by Princeton University, viruses find in dry air a better environment for reproduction and proliferation, in addition to that the drying of the mucous membranes in the nose and throat makes it easier for viruses to enter the body.

    2- Doing sports
    The physically fit body recovers quickly when attacked by viruses, and people who exercise for 60 minutes twice or three times a week are less likely to be infected with viruses, and the immune system can be strengthened by walking for 30 minutes a day.

    3- A proper diet
    There are many nutrients that help to strengthen the immune system, including vitamin "C" found in citrus fruits, selenium found in nuts, vitamin "D" in fatty fish, zinc in oatmeal, and iron in red meat. A study demonstrated that consuming 75 mg of zinc daily reduced the frequency of colds by a third.

    4- Good mood
    A study from the University of Kentucky showed that the immune system develops well for optimistic people who think positively, just as fear drops this immune wall, so it is recommended to do things that feel happy and avoid permanent stress.
