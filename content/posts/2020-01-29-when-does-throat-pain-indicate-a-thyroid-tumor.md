The German Association of Otolaryngologists said that sore throat is not due to a common cold, especially if it is not accompanied by the distinct symptoms of a cold, which are runny nose, sneezing, and coughing.

The association indicated that throat pain may then indicate an infection of the pharynx, tonsillitis, laryngitis, vocal cords, glandular fever, or abscess.

Throat pain may also warn of a tumor in the neck or thyroid gland, especially if it is accompanied by symptoms such as difficulty breathing and a bloody cough.

Generally, you should consult a doctor if severe throat pain prevents the opening of the mouth or if it is accompanied by symptoms such as rash, hoarseness, discoloration of the tongue and swollen lymph nodes, to determine the true underlying cause of the pain, and to treat it in a timely manner.
