&#8216;Sen. Bernie Sanders answer to the reporter asking about the claim that Russia is helping get Bernie elected.
​&#8221; He is telling us they are interfering in this campaign right now in 2020. And will I say to Mr.​ Putin​ if elected president, trust me, you are not going to be interfering in American elections.

It was not clear what role they&#8217;re going to play. We were told that Russia may be other countries are getting involved in this campaign and look here&#8217;s the message to Russia stay out of American elections and what they are doing by the way the ugly thing that they are doing and I&#8217;ve seen some of you know, the tweets and stuff is they try to divide us up. That&#8217;s what they did in 2016 and that is the ugliest thing they&#8217;re doing is they are trying to cause chaos they are trying to cause hatred in America. It&#8217;s an ugly business.&#8221;

Sen. Bernie was told earlier about the Russian interference from Former acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker.
