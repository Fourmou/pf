    'Sen. Bernie Sanders answer to the reporter asking about the claim that Russia is helping get Bernie elected.

    ​" He is telling us they are interfering in this campaign right now in 2020. And will I say to Mr.​ Putin​ if elected president, trust me, you are not going to be interfering in American elections.

    It was not clear what role they're going to play. We were told that Russia may be other countries are getting involved in this campaign and look here's the message to Russia stay out of American elections and what they are doing by the way the ugly thing that they are doing and I've seen some of you know, the tweets and stuff is they try to divide us up. That's what they did in 2016 and that is the ugliest thing they're doing is they are trying to cause chaos they are trying to cause hatred in America. It's an ugly business."

    Sen. Bernie was told earlier about the Russian interference from Former acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker.
