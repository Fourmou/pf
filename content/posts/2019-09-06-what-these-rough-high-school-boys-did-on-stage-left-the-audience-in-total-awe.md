High school talent shows are a national pastime. They give everyone in the community a chance to observe the unique talents of their young and aspiring kiddos. Normally, there are quite a few crowd-pleasers, but you're in rare company to have seen the likes of what these high school teenagers pulled off They have a long and storied career ahead of them, and they haven't even graduated yet

Other than the famous Mario sketch, I'm not sure there's a single better talent show performance on record. I guess that means these boys have the victory within reach!
