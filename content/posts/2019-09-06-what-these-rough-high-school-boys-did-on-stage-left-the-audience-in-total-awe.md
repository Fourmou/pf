High school talent shows are a national pastime. They give everyone in the community a chance to observe the unique talents of their young and aspiring kiddos. Normally, there are quite a few crowd-pleasers, but you&#8217;re in rare company to have seen the likes of what these high school teenagers pulled off They have a long and storied career ahead of them, and they haven&#8217;t even graduated yet

Other than the famous Mario sketch, I&#8217;m not sure there&#8217;s a single better talent show performance on record. I guess that means these boys have the victory within reach!
