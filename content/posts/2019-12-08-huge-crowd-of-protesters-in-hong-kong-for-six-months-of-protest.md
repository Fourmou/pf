**The rally took place two weeks after the victory of the pro-democracy opposition in the local elections. 800,000 people were reunited, according to pro-democracy activists.**

A huge crowd of pro-democracy activists marched Sunday in the streets of Hong Kong. A march without violence organized for the anniversary of six months of protest against the Beijing regime.

According to the figure of the movement Eric Lai, a member of the Civic Front for Human Rights (CHRF), nearly 800,000 people gathered in the streets. Nearly one in ten inhabitants of the island. The police, which traditionally provides low numbers, rather table 183,000 people, its highest estimate for several months.

Since June, the former British colony has been through its most serious crisis since its return to Beijing in 1997, with almost daily actions calling for democratic reforms or asking for an investigation into the behavior of the police.

**Carrie Lam still much-criticized**  
The demonstration was taking place two weeks after the pro-democracy candidates triumphed in the November 24 local elections, which strongly contradicted the authorities&#8217; claim that the silent majority would oppose the protesters.

Many of them, dressed in black, were eager to express their anger over Beijing and the head of the Hong Kong executive, Carrie Lam. The latter refuses to accede to demands that are further reinforced by the recent electoral success. Cantonese pop star Denise Ho, whose music is banned in mainland China, posted a video of the event on Twitter with the caption &#8220;That&#8217;s your majority, Carrie Lam&#8221;.

&#8220;No matter how we express our views, through a peaceful march, through civilized elections, the government will not listen,&#8221; said a 50-year-old protester, calling himself Wong. &#8220;He obeys only the orders of the Chinese Communist Party&#8221;.

A fruit vendor, who gave his last name, Leung, was distributing free strawberries to protesters. &#8220;I wanted to bring something sweet for the Hong Kong people who had six very difficult months,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This is the last chance given by the people to Mrs. Lam,&#8221; Jimmy Sham, one of the leaders of the CHRF, told reporters on Friday. The latter, who advocates non-violence, organized the major demonstrations in June and July.

**Episodes of chaos more and more frequent**  
In recent months, the Hong Kong authorities have banned major gatherings, citing risks of violence. Major demonstrations, however, have not ceased to brave these prohibitions. Many have degenerated into violent clashes between protesters and law enforcement, plunging the usually orderly megacity into recession and even chaos.

The reputation of the police has been severely damaged by these months of unrest. The police respond that they only respond to a rise in violence of the most radical protesters.

Many online forums used by protesters call for marking this anniversary on Monday with a new action blocking large-scale public transport, in case of lack of response from the local executive.
