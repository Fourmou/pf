Fibromyalgia, or fibromyalgia, is a chronic condition caused by an imbalance in the treatment of pain in the body, according to the Federal Health Awareness Center.

He explained that this situation is characterized by the spread of pain in various places such as muscles, joints, and tendons, in addition to abdominal and intestinal pain, breathing difficulties, urinary incontinence and constant fatigue.

Fibromyalgia also affects the psyche, and physical disorders are often associated with psychological ones, such as sleep disorders, poor concentration, poor mood, and a sense of fear and anxiety.

The cause of fibromyalgia is not yet known, but doctors believe it is due to genetic factors or long-lasting psychological stress.

Treatment is based on holistic concepts at the physical and psychological levels in order to relieve chronic pain.

Some doctors often prescribe low-dose depression to patients, but this does not mean that fibromyalgia is a type of depression, but these drugs have a pain-relieving effect.

Relaxation techniques can also be used to help relieve pain such as meditation and progressive muscular relaxation. Exercise can also help patients with severe pain, fatigue, and exhaustion.

In addition, healthy nutrition can help relieve trouble, so patients should eat more fresh vegetables and fruits and reduce meat, and some patients may benefit from a vegetarian diet.
