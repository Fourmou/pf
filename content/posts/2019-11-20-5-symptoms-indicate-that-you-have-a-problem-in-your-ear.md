    If you have any of these symptoms you should see your doctor as soon as possible to see if you have a problem with your ears.

    The ear of the ear is one of the smallest and most complex structures of the organism and is usually more prone to problems that must be identified in time to avoid complications.

    Hearing disorders, especially progressive hearing loss, can be exacerbated without showing many signs, so a doctor's visit is necessary.

    Here we highlight the five main symptoms that mean that the ear has some problems:

    Temporary hearing loss in one or both ears
    We may experience severe hearing loss caused by noise, and this happens when we experience a high amount of high noise for a long period of time. Symptoms often include hearing loss in one or both ears, where sounds can be heard as if we were wearing earplugs.

    Other causes include wax buildup in the ears, foreign body in the ear, or previous injuries to the inner, middle or outer ear.

    2 - intermittent tinnitus in the ear
    This type of annoying and intermittent tinnitus is not a symptom of madness, but a symptom of ear disorders, such as hearing loss due to age, ear injury, or even a circulatory disorder or any other disorder.

    3. Discomfort from small noise
    Do you feel nervous when someone chews? Are you upset about the sound of knives when eating? If you get upset with things like that, you may have a disorder in your ear. This is called "misophonia", a neurological disease characterized by a negative emotional reaction to hearing some of the sounds that cause him anger and tension, that is, a neurological disorder located in the upper structures of the central nervous system.

    Based on the emotional response it generates, a doctor should be consulted, although there is still a cure for these diseases except for some types of cognitive-behavioral therapy.

    4- Vertigo
    Or "Mounir's disease" is a disorder in the inside of the ear that will cause severe dizziness and severe patriotism, as well as a feeling of pressure and pain in the ear. The condition is chronic, and doctors are still unaware of its exact cause, although fluid accumulation and drainage problems from the ear can contribute to the disorder. Monier's disease usually affects one ear and is a common cause of deafness.

    5 - hear your pulse continuously
    This type of symptom is different from tinnitus and is known as pulsating or rhythmic tinnitus.

    Pulsed tinnitus is often caused by certain health problems, such as irregular blood vessels, high blood pressure, atherosclerosis, or head and neck tumors.
