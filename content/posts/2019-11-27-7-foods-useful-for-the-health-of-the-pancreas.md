    The pancreas plays a key role in the digestion and regulation of blood sugar levels.

    The pancreas produces two types of secretions: the first is excreted to the gut, where it secretes a juicer containing digestive enzymes. The second is internal to the bloodstream, and includes a number of hormones; the most important of which is insulin, which acts on the representation of sugar and carbohydrates, which leads to the imbalance of diabetes.

    Beneficial foods for the pancreas include:

    1- Turmeric
    Turmeric is a magic spice that contains a large number of vitamins and minerals as well as antioxidants, and is useful for the pancreas, according to a report published by the Russian "FPR" by the author Maria Voronova.

    2- garlic
    The garlic and honey mixture can be taken on an empty stomach every morning. In general, garlic contains a number of beneficial substances, the effect of which is comparable to that of antibiotics. Moreover, this natural drug helps to protect the immune system and strengthen the pancreas.

    3- Spinach
    Spinach is a good product for the health of the pancreas, and you can prepare a dish of salad whose main components are onions, garlic and spinach.

    4- Broccoli
    The author stated that broccoli is a vegetable rich in vitamins, and has features that protect the pancreas from various diseases.

    5- Red grapes
    Red grapes contain antioxidants that reduce inflammation in the pancreas and destroy cancer cells. Because of its numerous and varied benefits, experts recommend eating red grapes at least once a week.

    6- Sweet potatoes
    Sweet potatoes help reduce the risk of pancreatic disease by 50%.

    7- Oregano
    According to a group of research, oregano is a very useful product for pancreatic health.

    Tips to keep the pancreas healthy
    1 - Eat healthy trans fats found in avocado, olive oil, oily fish and nuts.

    2 - Avoid drinking alcohol, processed foods, and refined carbohydrates, as they affect the secretion of insulin.

    3 - drink the right amount of water.
