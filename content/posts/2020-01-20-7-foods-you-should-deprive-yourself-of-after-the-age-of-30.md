Once you reach the age of thirty, your body metabolic rate will decline, so you should be careful with foods you eat at this age, otherwise, you may be overweight, obese, and health problems.

The American “Nutrition” website said you should realize that your diet plays an important role in aging and that choosing healthy foods can slow it down.

Here we offer seven types of foods to stay away from when they reach the age of thirty:

**1- Sugar**
It provides you with empty calories with fat accumulation in the thighs, stomach, and other fat storage areas. Excess sugar causes weight gain and may contribute to infertility, in addition to accelerating the appearance of wrinkles and sagging skin.

**2- Canned foods**
Addressing them is one of the choices we prefer most of the time, especially if we are busy with a lot of other tasks. In contrast, one serving of these foods often contain elevated levels of salt, sugar, and fats, not to mention chemical additives. It also includes a small percentage of fiber, which makes you feel hungry quickly.

And canned foods can include monosodium glutamate, which makes the food taste good and increases your appetite. It is likely to contain a high content of bisphenol, which some say causes hormonal imbalances, cancer, infertility, and weight gain.

**3- Brominated Vegetable Oil**
Its consumption causes memory loss and other nerve problems, not to mention some internal infections. In the event that you have concerns about thyroid or fertility, you should give up this type of oil.

This type of oil is a mixture of triglycerides derived from plants that are bound to the bromine atoms. Used in soft drinks.

**4- White flour**
It lacks fiber, so it is best to consume whole grains that the body slowly digests. This will help you feel full longer.

**5- Partially Hydrogenated Oils and Trans fats**
Digesting the vegetable ghee that you place on a whole grain sandwich is difficult for your body.

Hydrogenated and partially hydrogenated vegetable oils affect the health of your heart and cause chronic inflammation. For men, contrast fat contributes to decreased fertility and hormonal disorders, as well as reduces memory and brain function.

**6- Processed meat**
Although it is delicious, it contains large amounts of nitrates, which is a carcinogen. Therefore, you should avoid it because it contains nitrate. It is also rich in high levels of sodium and saturated fat that endanger your heart health.

**7- Bleached (cream) coffee**
It is made from cross fat that affects the heart, joints, brain functions, and hormones. After you reach the age of thirty, you must give up drinking this type of coffee.
