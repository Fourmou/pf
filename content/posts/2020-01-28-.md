    The physical education teacher opened the door, but the wrong one. He suddenly found himself in the changing room of school girls. What was that now Evil intention? A mere oversight?
  
  
  
    In any case, the incident ended up some time ago with the complaint management of the Canisius College. For Gabriele Hüdepohl, the headmistress, who also dealt with the case, it was ultimately “a form of thoughtlessness on the part of the teacher.”
  
  
  
    No reason for great excitement. But the students came forward, which is crucial for Gabriele Hüdepohl. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s good that students have the courage to talk about it,&#8221; she says.
  
  
  
    Klaus Mertes says: &#8220;The culture at school has changed.&#8221;
  
  
  
  
  
  ### 
    Several students told about sexual abuse in the 70 years
  
  
  
    The Jesuit Mertes has contributed significantly to this. At the 28. January 2010, ten years ago, is his letter to 600 former high school graduates of the Canisius College have become public.
  
  
  
    Mertes had written what he said on 14. January 2010 three former students of the college had announced. They had two Jesuit fathers who taught at the school in the 1970 sexually abused for years.
  
  
  
    The shocked Mertes had to assume based on the descriptions that there were many more victims. His letter shocked the public. Sexual abuse of children became a social issue.
  
  
  
    Ten years after the abuse cases at the Canisius College in Berlin were uncovered, the Federal Government&#8217;s Commissioner for Abuse, Johannes-Wilhelm Rörig, wants to take stock today. After the events at the college became known, many other cases of abuse by lay Catholics, priests and religious were discovered throughout Germany.
  
  
  
    The federal government reacted by appointing an abuse officer and setting up an independent commission that listens anonymously to those affected and tries to uncover structures that favor child abuse.
  
  
  ### 
    What did the school learn from history?
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
    Gabriele Hüdepohl is sitting at a conference table in her office, through the window you can see the sports field of the Canisius College. In the first week after the Christmas holidays, the abuse of the past was discussed again in all classes, on the occasion of the tenth anniversary, of course. “For the students,” says Hüdepohl, “the questions are: what is our school like today? What did she learn from history? Do we feel safe here? ”
  
  
  
    Then she lists what has changed, why the students should feel safe here now. &#8220;We have developed a professional protection and prevention concept together with specialist institutions. We have formulated student rights and a code of conduct for teachers. ”
  
  
  ### 
    Complaint management was developed
  
  
  
    Complaint management was developed. And every student goes twice in his school career in specialist institutions that deal with sexual violence and sexual abuse. The fifth grades inform themselves at &#8220;Kind im Zentrum&#8221;, the eighth grades at &#8220;Wildwasser&#8221; or &#8220;Thaw&#8221;. The children and adolescents, says Hüdepohl, should know where the points of contact are that they can go to if they do not want to address problems at school.
  
  
  
    Serious suspected cases relating to the school , Indications of sexual violence, says Gabriele Hüdepohl, have been there 2010 no longer exist. Complaints management ends up with messages that someone made hurtful comments or that a student felt that she had been viewed inappropriately. Reports that are being investigated, but which do not have the dimensions of previous cases.
  
  
  ### 
    &#8220;Back then there were many Jesuits who were also teachers&#8221;
  
  
  
    But, says the headmistress, “we found out about suspicious cases that were not in the school area. The school has become a place where you can talk about such cases. ”The youth welfare office and the police would then have to provide further information. &#8220;It is very important,&#8221; says the headmistress, &#8220;that adults recognize that they are responsible for creating structures in which children are safe and are heard.&#8221;
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
    There were already 2010 Indications of sexual abuse at the college, but they were not taken seriously or deliberately ignored.
  
  
  
    The image of the church, the image of the highly regarded school, was more important at that time. The institution of the Catholic high school is the Jesuit order, before 40 Years ago the Jesuits and school were even more closely interlinked than today.
  
  
  
    &#8220;Back then there were many Jesuits who were also teachers&#8221;, says Gabriele Hüdepohl, &#8220;now only one Jesuit is teaching.&#8221; The principal and managing director of the school, Marco Mohr, is however a Jesuit .
  
  
  ### 
    &#8220;I was scared&#8221;
  
  
  
    Gabriele Hüdepohl has been in charge of 13 years of school, Father Klaus Mertes had them immediately about the allegations the three students informed that he had also discussed the contents of the letter with her. &#8220;I was scared,&#8221; she says. She never received the relevant information. &#8220;I also do not assume that the teachers knew what was there.&#8221;
  
  
  ### 
    What should have been done differently?
  
  
  
    Looking back, what could you have done differently, Ms. Hüdepohl? Or have to?
  
  
  
    The headmistress lets the question affect her. After a pause, she says: “Difficult. I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m going to do 13 years should have been different. I might have had to go around. ”
  
  
  
    Specifically, she can&#8217;t think of anything. Of course, it also changed. &#8220;I have become much more sensitive to the issue of abuse of trust. It is always important that there is a culture of openness in school. ”
  
  
  ### 
    “ It was the greatest support for me at the time ”
  
  
  
  
  
  
    Gabriele Hüdepohl has driven this development. At least that explains Klaus Mertes. &#8220;It was the greatest support for me at the time,&#8221; he says on the phone. “Ms. Hüdepohl has the great merit of being fully responsible. In doing so, she prevented most non-Jesuit colleagues from saying: This is all a problem for the Jesuits. ”
  
  
  
    Mertes left 2011 the Canisius College, now he is director of the Jesuit College St. Blasien.
  
  
  ### 
    The structures of the Jesuits have changed radically
  
  
  
    The Jesuits have also changed their structures radically according to 2010. &#8220;Jesuits now have to produce a police certificate of good conduct before they can do pastoral work,&#8221; says Mertes. &#8220;There are training courses, the training has been extended to the topic of sexual abuse.&#8221;
  
  
  
    There are &#8220;two key issues&#8221; for him. The first is &#8220;professionalization on the level of distance and closeness in the pastoral relationship&#8221;, the second &#8220;taking responsibility for the victims&#8221;.
  
  
  
    The Jesuit Order paid for therapy costs, refinanced training courses and paid additional pensions. So far, the Catholic Church generally pays victims as a recognition of suffering 5000. In some cases, the total can also be higher.

    This is far too little for the victims. Matthias Katsch is spokesman for the “Eckiger Tisch” initiative, he is one of the three students who went to Mertes at the time. He sees the 5000 euro as &#8220;symbolic recognition&#8221;. As such, it was an “affront. But if you should consider it as compensation, it is absolutely ridiculous. &#8220;

    The two Jesuits who sexually abused him and others were never brought to justice. Your actions are time-barred. One of the perpetrators has been living in Chile for many years, the other has the Church Court of the Archdiocese of Berlin in November 2013 sentenced to a fine of 4000). In addition, he is no longer allowed to hold the priesthood, but remains a priest.
  
  
  
    Mertes is still in close contact with Katsch. At the 14. January 2020 he said in a phone call: &#8220;Thank you for me ten years ago visited.&#8221;
