Impeached by the House of Representatives and acquitted by the Senate &#8230; In just 50 days, Trump, the 45th President of the United States, experienced two very historic moments during his tenure. At this moment, he is running for re-election, becoming the third president in American history to be acquitted after being impeached after Johnson and Clinton.
Why did the impeachment drama break out? The &#8220;big show&#8221; in the past six months must start with a phone call

In August 2019, a whistleblower claimed that Trump had sought help from Ukraine to discredit political opponents during a phone call with the President of Ukraine in July. US media reports said that at least a week before calling the President of Ukraine, Trump told White House officials to suspend the provision of nearly \$ 400 million in military aid to Ukraine. Trump said after the incident came out that the move was due to fears that US aid to Ukraine would exceed European countries. The person responsible for the impeachment investigation believes that the move is suspected of using his power to pressure Ukraine, affecting the 2020 elections, and seizing military aid to Ukraine may also damage national security, and Trump tried to hide it.

On September 24, 2019, Pelosi, the Democratic speaker of the House of Representatives, announced that the House of Representatives has launched an impeachment investigation against Trump.

For the investigation he faced On September 25, 2019, Trump met with Zelensky in New York to attend the UN General Assembly event. Trump said he did not put pressure on Ukraine during the call, and the Democrats&#8217; impeachment investigation against him was &#8220;political persecution.&#8221; Zelensky said that he did not want to be involved in the US election and that no one was pressured. Ukraine is an independent country.

On October 2, 2019, Elijah Cummings, chairman of the House of Representatives Supervisory Committee, threatened that if the White House does not hand over all the documents involved, a subpoena will be issued to the White House. On October 8, the White House sent a 8-page letter to Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Pelosi, which stated that Trump and the White House&#8217;s attitudes to the &#8220;impeachment&#8221; stated that they refused to cooperate with the investigation and said the impeachment &#8221; &#8220;Unfounded, unconstitutional and aimed at overthrowing the democratic process in the United States.&#8221; On October 10, the US Congress summoned Energy Secretary Perry on Trump&#8217;s &#8220;phone door&#8221;. On October 31, the US House of Representatives voted to pass the impeachment investigation process. On November 13, the United States will hold its first public hearing on the Trump impeachment investigation.

On November 9th, Trump said it was &#8220;likely&#8221; to announce the record of another call with Ukrainian President Zelensky next Tuesday (12th)-this call occurred in April and was triggered by the impeachment investigation of the US President Before the critical call. On November 15, Mary Jovanovic, a former US ambassador to Ukraine, who was removed by President Trump, testified before Congress. On December 18, the US House of Representatives voted to pass two impeachment clauses against President Trump. Trump became the third U.S. president to be formally impeached by Congress.

On January 21, 2020, the U.S. Senate begins formal hearings

Until February 5, local time, the United States Senate, which is responsible for hearing the US President Trump&#8217;s impeachment vote, rejected two impeachment clauses against Trump. The US Senate, with 52 votes against and 48 votes in favor, found that the impeachment clause accusing Trump of abusing his powers was not established, and 53 votes against 47 votes in favor found that the impeachment clause against Trump impeded Congress.

Both votes were almost lined up according to the party. Trump has not been convicted and will not be fired. The reason for the impeachment trial is now over. At this time, Trump naturally still has to speak through Twitter.

That night, Trump first reposted a short synthetic video with the cover of Time magazine, which appeared with campaign logos such as &#8220;Trump 2024&#8221;, &#8220;Trump 2028&#8221;, and &#8220;Trump 2032&#8221;. Moreover, he also tweeted.

In addition, Trump said in another tweet that he would speak at noon U.S. time on Thursday to talk about his victory in the &#8220;impeachment scam.&#8221;

Sure enough, Trump appeared at the White House on Thursday to speak at the White House. He set the impeachment incident as soon as he came up!

&#8220;This is a celebration,&#8221; Trump said.

&#8220;This is the result&#8221;, Trump continued to &#8220;open up&#8221;, he took out a copy of the &#8220;Washington Post&#8221; that day, the headline read: Trump is not guilty. He gave the Washington Post to his wife Melania and joked that he would go home to frame it.

He then pointed his finger at Pelosi and related Democrats Adam Schiff and others.

&#8220;These people are so evil. Adam Schiff is an evil and terrible person. Pelosi is also a terrible person. She wanted to impeach me long ago.&#8221;

On the other side, Pelosi, the speaker of the US House of Representatives, said in a statement that President Trump and Republican lawmakers were &#8220;lawless.&#8221;

Compared to their &#8220;mouth shots&#8221;, in fact, the &#8220;face-to-face tricks&#8221; of the two sides the previous day are more interesting.

The night before the Senate vote, on February 4, US time, Trump issued the third State of the Union address in Congress, covering the US economy, border control, reform of the immigration system, and the Iranian nuclear issue. In the replay of the old tune, it is not the State Consultation body that caused the world media&#8217;s greater attention, but two &#8220;little moves&#8221; on the scene.

Before Trump delivered his State of the Union address, Speaker of the House of Representatives Pelosi reached out to him to shake hands, but Trump seemed to intentionally ignore Pelosi&#8217;s move; and when Trump&#8217;s speech was over, everyone stood and applauded Pelosi, who was standing behind Trump, tore up the text of her State of the Union address in public.

CNN reports that it is unclear whether Trump has deliberately ignored the handshake, and people familiar with the matter also told CNN that Pelosi&#8217;s tearing of the speech was not intentional, but was angered by its content.

However, later videos and pictures exposed by the media showed that Pelosi was actually ready to &#8220;pre-tear&#8221; when she was listening to the speech: she had made small moves under the table in advance, and she could be seen in the camera behind the table. The side of the lecture note has been torn open to facilitate tearing.

CNN said in the report that these two small moves undoubtedly show a worsening relationship between Trump and Pelosi, and the two have not communicated for months. In Washington, the impeachment that lasted nearly half a year and the upcoming 2020 US election has deepened hostility between the two parties.

According to the Democrats, the two charges they charged were &#8220;stubborn,&#8221; but from the Republican attitude, they were &#8220;untenable.&#8221; This partisan disagreement is exactly the epitome of American society. After all, it&#8217;s not the Democrats that are stupid, but it&#8217;s the divided United States that keeps them from getting elected. This in itself is a satire of the political system and social values ​​that the United States sells everywhere.
