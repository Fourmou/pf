Patellofemoral pain syndrome,  sacroiliac joint, temporomandibular joint dysfunction are the three major classed joints issues of all time, the pain and stiffness in joints make even the simplest thing to do seem like a burden, and it worsen day today and make life complicated.
    Frozen shoulder, bursitis hip, and knee, arthritis in hands, big toe pain, sacrum pain, and tendonitis ankle can turn into serious health problems like osteoporosis, TMJ and may require operational intervention later in life for a joint replacement. For the importance of this subject, we tried to compile this complete guide to let you discover the causes and symptoms, relief methods, treatment, facts and myths about joints pain and much eye-opening stuff that could help anyone through his life journey.

    Supplements and Medications To Help Joint Pain


    Vitamin D. The number one supplement I recommend for joint health and overall musculoskeletal health is vitamin D3.

    Estrogen. Estrogen is important for musculoskeletal health, including joint health.
    Glucosamine and Chondroitin Sulfate.
    MSM.
    Turmeric.
    Omega 3.
    SAMe.






    Doctors consider these conditions like frozen shoulder, temporomandibular joint dysfunction, patellofemoral pain syndrome, sacroiliac joint, bursitis hip to be chronic health problems, means that there is no final cure that will make the condition go away forever, however, there are ways to manage the pain, natural ways, and medical treatment






    Pineapple water can relief joints pain: Bromelain, a digestive protein enzyme that exists by an excessive way in the water of pineapple, surprisingly this enzyme can take away any type of inflammation. It is highly effective relief osteoarthritis pain as some anti-inflammatory medications like ibuprofen, at least when it’s taken in supplement form. Many pieces of research papers suggest that this enzyme may also reduce the pain result of RA. The most advised way to benefit from this enzyme from pineapple is to eat it between meals, the enzymes will be used up digesting your food, and choose fresh or frozen pineapple, not canned pineapple or pineapple juice.
    Ginger tea for osteoarthritis and sacroiliac joint pain: Ginger is a well-known plant for the long list of benefits it has for our body, a flowering plant used for cooking, you can't miss its flavor or odor, very powerful, unique and sharp, it has been used as a natural medicine for centuries now, Ginger has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anticancer properties. Because of this, it’s thought to boost your overall immunity. For people with temporomandibular joint dysfunction, patellofemoral pain syndrome or sacroiliac joint, its anti-inflammatory properties are of particular benefit. Ginger contains anti-inflammatory compounds that function in the same way as COX-2 inhibitors. COX-2 inhibitors are drugs used to treat pain and inflammation. Here we present to you a recipe For Pain Relief Ginger Tea:

    1 liter of water
    3 cm fresh ginger
    Lemon juice
    Honey

    1. Boil water & chop ginger.
    2. Add ginger into boiling water.
    3. Let your tea simmer 10-15 minutes to bring out the best out of ginger.
    4. Filter your tea and finish it with lemon juice and honey.
    ENJOY..!!!!






    CBD oil for joints pain relief: CBD acts as a muscle relaxant so if your back pain, sacrum pain or tendonitis ankle are muscle-related it should help, give it a try you won't getting high due to the lack of THC if you choose your CBD carefully. Now i am going to present to you a brief paragraph on the medical treatment just so to know about. Organic CBD Oil

    And don't forget to pay attention to your sleep habits, it may cause you a lot of joint pain if you have a bad position, here are some good positions to make yourself more comfortable and avoid any related pain in the future.








     
    Medical treatment
    Your treatment options will depend on the cause of the pain. In some cases, your doctor will need to draw out accumulated fluid in the joint area to test for infection or gout or other causes of the joint pain. They might also recommend surgery to replace the joint.
    Other nonsurgical treatment methods could include lifestyle changes or medications that can potentially cause your RA to go into remission. In the case of RA, your doctor will first address inflammation. Once the RA goes into remission, your medical treatment will focus on keeping a tight rein on your condition so that you avoid flare-ups.

    Now we are going to present you with the most tremendous myths around joints pain that you must know and pay attention to:

    Now with a very important part, ask the expert we did compile here some very serious questions with their answers from an expert in the field here is the first question, Does humidity cause joint pain?
    This is an excellent question and one that does not have an easy answer. Many people with knee osteoarthritis report increased pain with temperature or bad weather conditions (cold makes it worse, and stormy weather makes it worse). It's not a question of humidity but rather of barometric pressure.
    There is a 2007 study involving >200 with knee osteoarthritis in the United States which participated in an online study reporting their pain daily, on a scale, for 3 months. Weather conditions were available for all participating locations. The participants did not know that weather was going to be one of the parameters they used in the study, to rule out that people reported more pain in relation to meteorologic conditions, because they are so convinced that's the case, that they will report it.
    Interestingly, the study showed that indeed, barometric pressure and temperature both affected pain severity in a statistically significant fashion in this group of people.
    Possible reasons are:
    1) for stormy weather conditions, atmospheric pressure appears to play a role in the biomechanics of stabilizing the joint (typically divers report joint pain during compression)
    2) for cold weather, the temperature can affect the viscosity of the synovial fluid, and also there can be more inflammatory mediators in the joint space.

    Is there a connection between altitude and joint pain?
    Lower pressure is a fairly common complaint amongst people with a history of joint problems.
    That is, if your knees have never bothered you, low pressure isn’t likely to be a problem.
    Do you have an arthritic knee? Low pressure could be an issue.
    Think of the atmosphere as a layer above us, pressing down. As we go up the atmosphere, the layer above us isn’t as much, so there isn’t as much pressure on us.
    Our bodies exert their own internal pressure, pushing outwards. As we go up the atmosphere, our bodies’ pressure increases relative to the pressure of the atmosphere pushing against us.
    This is why astronauts wear spacesuits: the suit presses against their body to prevent the body from expanding. (There’s no atmosphere in space.)
    If you have a joint which is already generally sensitive, having it expand might not feel great.
    This is also more the rationale behind why people complain about cold weather and their joints. Cold weather tends to go with low pressure.

    Can sleeping with bent knees cause joint pain?
    Sleeping with bent knees cause joint pain due to bleeding into the joints, strains, and sprains, septic arthritis, torn ligaments, tendons. Other than this there was less chance to get knee pain while sleeping with bent knees.
    Even that too don’t sleep with the bent knees the whole night sometimes give stretch to the legs and then bent knees and start sleeping.

    Here we come to the end we hope you enjoy the reading and that the article was informative to you by any mean, don't forget to visit our other articles and to keep in tune with what's coming.

#### Medical treatment

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Your treatment options will depend on the cause of the pain. In some cases, your doctor will need to draw out accumulated fluid in the joint area to test for infection or gout or other causes of the joint pain. They might also recommend surgery to replace the joint.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Other nonsurgical treatment methods could include lifestyle changes or medications that can potentially cause your RA to go into remission. In the case of RA, your doctor will first address inflammation. Once the RA goes into remission, your medical treatment will focus on keeping a tight rein on your condition so that you avoid flare-ups.

A 10-minute video compile all the necessary stretch for your joints pain :

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Now with a very important part, ask the expert we did compile here some very serious questions with their answers from an expert in the field here is the first question, <strong>Does humidity cause joint pain?</strong>
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  This is an excellent question and one that does not have an easy answer. Many people with knee osteoarthritis report increased pain with temperature or bad weather conditions (cold makes it worse, and stormy weather makes it worse). It&#8217;s not a question of humidity but rather of barometric pressure.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  There is a 2007 study involving >200 with knee osteoarthritis in the United States which participated in an online study reporting their pain daily, on a scale, for 3 months. Weather conditions were available for all participating locations. The participants did not know that weather was going to be one of the parameters they used in the study, to rule out that people reported more pain in relation to meteorologic conditions, because they are so convinced that&#8217;s the case, that they will report it.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Interestingly, the study showed that indeed, barometric pressure and temperature both affected pain severity in a statistically significant fashion in this group of people.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Possible reasons are:<br /> 1) for stormy weather conditions, atmospheric pressure appears to play a role in the biomechanics of stabilizing the joint (typically divers report joint pain during compression)<br /> 2) for cold weather, the temperature can affect the viscosity of the synovial fluid, and also there can be more inflammatory mediators in the joint space.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  <strong>Is there a connection between altitude and joint pain?</strong>
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Lower pressure is a fairly common complaint amongst people with a history of joint problems.<br /> That is, if your knees have never bothered you, low pressure isn’t likely to be a problem.<br /> Do you have an arthritic knee? Low pressure could be an issue.<br /> Think of the atmosphere as a layer above us, pressing down. As we go up the atmosphere, the layer above us isn’t as much, so there isn’t as much pressure on us.<br /> Our bodies exert their own internal pressure, pushing outwards. As we go up the atmosphere, our bodies’ pressure increases relative to the pressure of the atmosphere pushing against us.<br /> This is why astronauts wear spacesuits: the suit presses against their body to prevent the body from expanding. (There’s no atmosphere in space.)<br /> If you have a joint which is already generally sensitive, having it expand might not feel great.<br /> This is also more the rationale behind why people complain about cold weather and their joints. Cold weather tends to go with low pressure.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  <strong>Can sleeping with bent knees cause joint pain?</strong>
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Sleeping with bent knees cause joint pain due to bleeding into the joints, strains, and sprains, septic arthritis, torn ligaments, tendons. Other than this there was less chance to get knee pain while sleeping with bent knees.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Even that too don’t sleep with the bent knees the whole night sometimes give stretch to the legs and then bent knees and start sleeping.
