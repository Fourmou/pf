#### Medical treatment


Your treatment options will depend on the cause of the pain. In some cases, your doctor will need to draw out accumulated fluid in the joint area to test for infection or gout or other causes of the joint pain. They might also recommend surgery to replace the joint.



Other nonsurgical treatment methods could include lifestyle changes or medications that can potentially cause your RA to go into remission. In the case of RA, your doctor will first address inflammation. Once the RA goes into remission, your medical treatment will focus on keeping a tight rein on your condition so that you avoid flare-ups.

A 10-minute video compile all the necessary stretch for your joints pain :


  Now with a very important part, ask the expert we did compile here some very serious questions with their answers from an expert in the field here is the first question, **Does humidity cause joint pain?**



  This is an excellent question and one that does not have an easy answer. Many people with knee osteoarthritis report increased pain with temperature or bad weather conditions (cold makes it worse, and stormy weather makes it worse). It&#8217;s not a question of humidity but rather of barometric pressure.



  There is a 2007 study involving >200 with knee osteoarthritis in the United States which participated in an online study reporting their pain daily, on a scale, for 3 months. Weather conditions were available for all participating locations. The participants did not know that weather was going to be one of the parameters they used in the study, to rule out that people reported more pain in relation to meteorologic conditions, because they are so convinced that&#8217;s the case, that they will report it.



  Interestingly, the study showed that indeed, barometric pressure and temperature both affected pain severity in a statistically significant fashion in this group of people.



  Possible reasons are: 1) for stormy weather conditions, atmospheric pressure appears to play a role in the biomechanics of stabilizing the joint (typically divers report joint pain during compression) 2) for cold weather, the temperature can affect the viscosity of the synovial fluid, and also there can be more inflammatory mediators in the joint space.



  **Is there a connection between altitude and joint pain?**



  Lower pressure is a fairly common complaint amongst people with a history of joint problems. That is, if your knees have never bothered you, low pressure isn’t likely to be a problem. Do you have an arthritic knee? Low pressure could be an issue. Think of the atmosphere as a layer above us, pressing down. As we go up the atmosphere, the layer above us isn’t as much, so there isn’t as much pressure on us. Our bodies exert their own internal pressure, pushing outwards. As we go up the atmosphere, our bodies’ pressure increases relative to the pressure of the atmosphere pushing against us. This is why astronauts wear spacesuits: the suit presses against their body to prevent the body from expanding. (There’s no atmosphere in space.) If you have a joint which is already generally sensitive, having it expand might not feel great. This is also more the rationale behind why people complain about cold weather and their joints. Cold weather tends to go with low pressure.



  **Can sleeping with bent knees cause joint pain?**



  Sleeping with bent knees cause joint pain due to bleeding into the joints, strains, and sprains, septic arthritis, torn ligaments, tendons. Other than this there was less chance to get knee pain while sleeping with bent knees.



  Even that too don’t sleep with the bent knees the whole night sometimes give stretch to the legs and then bent knees and start sleeping.
