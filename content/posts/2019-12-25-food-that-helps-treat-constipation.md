Studies have reported that the defecation rate of only three times or less during one week is a sign that the person suffers from constipation, according to the American Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.

Here we offer three foods to treat constipation.

Feces in constipation are dry, and defecation is difficult and painful. It is a common problem among the majority of the world's population and can be treated with simple tricks.

In fact, diet plays a crucial role in avoiding constipation problems by incorporating foods that have positive effects on digestion and defecation.

Adherence to a diet that includes foods to aid digestion is not sufficient to get rid of constipation problems, as providing the body with adequate amounts of water is crucial in this regard. This is according to the report of the author, Evan Amingual, in the Spanish magazine Mijor Kun Salud.

And all people have suffered at least once in their lives from the problems of constipation, and in most cases, these problems are not as serious as they do not last long.

Although it is not necessary to defecate daily. However, if changes are observed in the level of bowel movements, consult a doctor.

How can I reduce constipation problems?

1- Exercise, especially helping the enemy, or hiking, and swimming, to alleviate the problems of constipation, provided that this is done at the rate of three or four times per week.
