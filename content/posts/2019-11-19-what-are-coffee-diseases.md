Coffee is a popular drink, and some people say they can&#8217;t imagine living without it, but drinking too much can lead to “caffeine poisoning”.

Dr. Walid Sarhan, a Jordanian psychiatrist, says that coffee is a favorite international beverage, which is surpassed only in oil by international trade.

Under the title &#8220;Coffee Diseases,&#8221; the psychiatrist consultant wrote on his Facebook page that the global demand for coffee is linked to its anabolic properties, which may be stressful for some, and stressful effects depend on the amount of coffee and other drinks associated with caffeine.

He explained that caffeine activates the nervous system, heart, and muscles and increases the secretions of the stomach and diuresis. A cup of tea, a cup of coffee, or a soft drink contains caffeine by 60-120 mg, and more recently, energy drinks that contain varying amounts of caffeine have spread.

He said that caffeine poisoning on the body usually starts when the dose exceeds 300 mg of caffeine per day.

Symptoms of caffeine poisoning include:

1 &#8211; Nervosity.

2 &#8211; tension and irritability.

3 &#8211; Difficulty sleeping.

4 &#8211; red face, who suffers from caffeine poisoning tends to facial redness.

5 &#8211; Increased diuresis.

6 &#8211; Gastrointestinal disorder.

7 &#8211; muscle tension.

8 &#8211; speech is not in the usual flow.

9 &#8211; increase heartbeat or disorder regularity.

10. This may be associated with increased activity and agitation in the nerves, and this occurs in a sufficient amount of 500 to 1000 mg.

Dr. Sarhan said that if we look at the rates of tea and coffee in our country, we will find that many people exceed ten cups of coffee and ten cups of tea, and this certainly more than 1000 mg of caffeine easily, then these caffeine poisoners are looking for hypnotic and soothing and treatment of the stomach and intestines and speed blows The heart, often smokers, traces caffeine with nicotine, forming a deadly binary.

**Habits**  
&#8220;Strangely enough, such individuals sit in waiting rooms in clinics and emergency departments smoking and drinking coffee, to enumerate these symptoms with smoking symptoms of cough, problems in the mouth, lungs and blood circulation,&#8221; he added. &#8220;In fact, many of our health problems, traffic accidents, and common behavioral problems are partly due to these habits, which have risen above review and discussion.&#8221;

He said that there are some patients with psychological anxiety who suffer from awe and tension and headaches and multiple physical pain and difficulty in sleep, they will find immediate improvement once you stop caffeine, and if stopped with nicotine may also end their problem.

&#8220;The many common sleep disorders that are difficult to start or break are some of the things that some insist have nothing to do with coffee, but the simple experience of loosening or stopping coffee for a few days will show the difference.&#8221;

He advised that healthy people should have a maximum of two cups of tea a day or two cups of coffee, stressing that adding milk to coffee and tea does not change the effects of caffeine only mitigate its effect on the stomach, as the Arabic coffee &#8211; which is usually not entered by people in particular because they drink In a small amount &#8211; they often contain a large proportion of the caffeine that accumulates with others, and for young people and enthusiasts of soft drinks and energy drinks should be cautioned to cross the limits.

For those suffering from an organic or psychological illness, it is OK to ask their doctor about coffee and other caffeinated beverages. The observation of human drinking of coffee, tea, soft drinks, and energy can be considered a means of psychological and physical health prevention.
