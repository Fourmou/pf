A new study indicated that people who eat many processed foods are more likely to develop diabetes compared to those whose diets contain more foods in their natural form.

Processed foods often contain a large amount of sugar, fat, and calories without any nutritional value.

The increased risk of a wide range of health problems &#8211; including heart disease, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, obesity and some types of cancer &#8211; has long been associated with the consumption of many of these foods.

The current study provides new evidence linking these foods to type 2 diabetes, which is the most common form of the disease and is usually associated with being overweight.

Among the people who participated in the study and consumed large quantities of processed foods, 166 out of every 100,000 people became diabetic, compared to 116 out of every 100,000 who consumed less of this type of food.

&#8220;We advise people to reduce the consumption of processed foods and eat unprocessed or simply processed foods, in addition to a healthy diet low in salt, sugar, fat, and calories, and maintaining an index Optimal body mass and a healthy lifestyle. &#8221;

Cypress and Touvier stated by e-mail that people looking to reduce their risk of diabetes should limit their consumption of red and processed meat, soft drinks and other sugary drinks.

They are also advised to eat lots of milk, vegetables, whole grains and nuts to help reduce the risk of diabetes.
