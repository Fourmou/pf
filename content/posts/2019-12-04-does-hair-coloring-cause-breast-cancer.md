"There is no doubt that we need more research to prove the results of our study. But we believe that exposure to chemical pigments increases the risk of breast cancer."

"The association between hair coloring and breast cancer does not mean that dye is the primary cause and that disease is the inevitable consequence," he said on Facebook.

He also tweeted that women over the age of 40 should undergo regular check-ups and that they could use natural, non-hazardous ingredients to dye hair.
