Granola bars are always a great option for an afternoon snack. They are quick, tasty, and healthy (well, most of the time). Some of the cheaper, store-bought bars contain a ton of high fructose corn syrup.

Thankfully, Meg from WhatsUpMoms has a simple recipe for homemade granola bars. Best of all, they don’ t require any baking in an oven and can be made gluten-free. They’ re tasty, healthy, quick, and easy. I certainly know what I’ ll be making tonight!
