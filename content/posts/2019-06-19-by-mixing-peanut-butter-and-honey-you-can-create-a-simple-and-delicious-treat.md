  Granola bars are always a great option for an afternoon snack. They are quick, tasty, and healthy (well, most of the time). Some of the cheaper, store-bought bars contain a ton of high fructose corn syrup.



  Thankfully, Meg from WhatsUpMoms has a simple recipe for homemade granola bars. Best of all, they don&#8217;t require any baking in an oven and can be made gluten-free. They&#8217;re tasty, healthy, quick, and easy. I certainly know what I&#8217;ll be making tonight!

  These granola bars are the perfect way to energize your kids. What&#8217;s great about this recipe is how it offers quite a bit of versatility when it comes to fruit choices. It lets you add simple flavors, wholesome ingredients, and lots of crunches. You&#8217;ll have to exercise a bit of self-control to not eat these in one go!
