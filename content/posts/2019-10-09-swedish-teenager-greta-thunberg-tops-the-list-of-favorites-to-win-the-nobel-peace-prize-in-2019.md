    Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg tops the list of favorites to win the Nobel Peace Prize in 2019, while others rule out her crowning under the nomination of Ethiopian Prime Minister Abe Ahmed and important international organizations.
    Greta Tonberg is active in the fight against climate change and has won the Amnesty International and Wright Lifestyle prize, which she considers to be the most favored betting websites.
    "This, if it happens, will provide the movement with greater recognition, stronger strength, and broader inclusiveness," Greta Thunberg said in a television interview.
    The teenager managed to shake world public opinion on the climate issue by launching a "school strike" that began in front of the Swedish parliament to gatherings currently attended by millions of young people in the world.
    At the end of September, she drew attention when she addressed world leaders meeting at the United Nations: "How dare you? You stole my dreams and my childhood," after she crossed the Atlantic on a sailboat.
    Dan Smith, director of the International Peace Research Institute in Stockholm, says Greta Tonberg is "a serious candidate."

    What she has done over the past year is exceptional. Climate change is a problem closely linked to security and peace.
    But Henrik Ordal, director of the Oslo Peace Research Institute, says the activities are not enough to win the Nobel Peace Prize.
    This is due to two reasons: firstly, the link between warming and armed conflict is not yet established, and secondly, its age as the prize can quickly become a burden.



    The only way for this to happen is to share the award with another person like Malala, a young Pakistani woman who won the award in 2014 at the age of 17, with Indian Kailash Satyarthi, a children's rights activist.

    "Of course, she is an international star, facing Donald Trump's criticism, and the spotlight is better than anyone else on climate change, but what she is playing against is her 16-year-old age," said Nobel Prize expert Asle Sven. Very 'if it happens.
    Reconciliation Engineer
    Ethiopian Prime Minister Abe Ahmed, the architect of reconciliation with Eritrea, has also been instrumental in resolving the crisis between the opposition and the junta in Sudan.
    "Abe is a good candidate because his mandate has promoted peace and limited authoritarianism in the country and the region," says Peter, an international affairs specialist.
    Other names are being circulated, such as the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), its president Filippo Grandi or even SOS Med, and NGOs such as Reporters Without Borders and CPJ.
    Nominations for the Nobel Peace Prize totaled 301, but the names are not revealed.
    Ladbrokes' bookmaker's office cited other names, such as American football star Megan Rapino and even US President Donald Trump for his efforts to improve relations with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.
    The winner will be unveiled on Friday at 9 am UTC at the Nobel Institute in Oslo.
    The award is worth $ 830,000, along with a gold medal and a diploma. Last year, Congolese doctor Denis Mukwigi and Yazidis Nadia Mourad were awarded in recognition of their efforts to combat sexual violence.
